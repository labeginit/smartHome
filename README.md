## Dependencies | Maven

Three dependencies will be utilized. GSON is used for parsing JSON. MongoDB is used for connecting to the database. And
Websocket is used for keeping track of clients connected and to broadcast messages.

| Library | Version | Link |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| GSON | 2.8.5 | https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.8.5
| MongoDB | 3.12.5 | https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongo-java-driver/3.12.5
| Spring-Websocket | 5.2.2 | https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-websocket/5.2.2.RELEASE

### _Usage_

**getDevices** - Is used for gathering all devices (NOT TV!) and their statuses, this is done via the **Websocket
Connection**.

#### Response

```json
[
  {
    "deviceID": "Kitchen Lamp",
    "on": false
  },
  {
    "deviceID": "Bathroom Lamp",
    "on": true
  },
  {
    "temperature": 19.1,
    "deviceID": "Livingroom Thermometer"
  },
  {
    "deviceID": "Livingroom Curtain",
    "open": false
  }
]
```

**changeDeviceStatus** - Is utilized for changing the status of a device.

### Example of request

```
changeDeviceStatus={'_id':'Livingroom Curtain', 'open':'false'}
```

**Note!** In order for the server to corretly parse the request, the command and "=" is important. This is because the
server splits the request into an array of two. The first index containing the **changeDeviceStatus** command. The
second index containg the payload **{'_id':'Livingroom Curtain', 'open':'false'}** in this case.

### Format for light

| _id | on |
| ------ | ------ |
| Kitchen Lamp | false/true

### Format for thermometer

| _id | temperature |
| ------ | ------ |
| Livingroom Thermometer | 0-100Â°C

### Format for curtains

| _id | open |
| ------ | ------ |
| Livingroom Curtain | false/true

### Example using Curl

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/changeDeviceStatus -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"deviceName\":\"Kitchen Lamp\",\"status\":\"off\"}"
```

### Response

The response comes in two alternatives, either if the request was successful or not.

#### successful

```json
{
  "operation": "success"
}
```

#### failed

```json
{
  "reason": "Kitchen Lamp is already off",
  "operation": "failed"
}
```

### Broadcasting

Once a user uses the Endpoint **/changeDeviceStatus**, a message will be broadcasted to each client. And if the request
fails, then a broadcast message wont be sent out.

#### Curtain changed example

```json
{
  "device": "curtain",
  "operation": "success",
  "option": "true"
}
```

## # Documentation for FreeChoice group
